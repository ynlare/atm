 atm lab
For Lab3 you will be creating an ATM program.

* Write a program that behaves like an ATM that you can interact with. You should be able to:

    * If you have a bank account, access it with a pin

    * Create a new bank account with a unique pin

    * Deposit money into the bank account and print the new balance

    * Withdraw money from the bank account and print the new balance

    * Get the balance of the bank account

    * Change the pin of the bank account

    * Your accounts should persist across sessions.

* You should take advantage of objects and functions to organize your ATM simulator.

* The code should be well documented with comments, have good code structure, and follow naming conventions.

* Push your code to your repository.
